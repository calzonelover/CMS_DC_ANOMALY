\chapter{Conclusions}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Semi-supervised learning yields a remarkable result and well describe outlier LS
    \item So far, there is no grey zone from our model for this dataset
    \item Bad LS could be divided into two parts
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Bad with some pattern
        \item Anomaly
    \end{itemize}
